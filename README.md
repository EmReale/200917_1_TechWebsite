# 200917_1_TechWebsite

This was a website that I created, based on concepts produced for the final submission for the Code First Girls: Introduction to Web Development course undertaken in August. 
It uses solely HTML5 and CSS, where the concept was to produce an aggregate site for people thinking of switching to a career in tech, showing them the best places to get started. 
So far, I have only worked on the landing page, with an aspiration to complete one pag for each proposed career path.
